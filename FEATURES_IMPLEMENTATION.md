# New Features Implementation Guide

This document describes the newly implemented features for the Time Tracking Application.

## üìÖ Timesheet Trigger System

Administrators can now control when employees can submit timesheets by defining timesheet periods with specific date ranges.

### Features
- **Admin Control**: Create, update, and delete timesheet periods
- **Date Range Management**: Define start and end dates for each period
- **User Access Control**: Restrict periods to specific employees or allow all employees
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for one-time, weekly, biweekly, and monthly recurring periods

- **Employee**: Validation happens automatically when creating timesheets

### Database Model
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  status: ['upcoming', 'active', 'closed'],
  isActive: Boolean,
  recurringType: ['none', 'weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly'],

## ‚úÖ Timesheet Validation & Limits

### Overview
Real-time validation during timesheet entry with error prevention and admin bypass capabilities.

### Features
- **Period Validation**: Ensure date is within an active timesheet period
- **Daily Limit Check**: Prevent exceeding daily hour limit
- **Weekly Limit Check**: Prevent exceeding weekly hour limit
- **Real-time Feedback**: Show current hours and projected total
- **Warning Messages**: Alert when approaching limits
- **Admin Bypass**: Admins can bypass limits when necessary

### Validation Flow
1. User enters timesheet date and hours
2. System checks if date is within active period
3. System validates against daily limit
4. System calculates current week hours
5. System validates against weekly limit
6. If near threshold, send warning notification
7. If over limit and enforcement enabled, reject entry

### Error Messages
- "The selected date is not within any allowed timesheet period"
- "Hours exceed daily limit of X hours"
- "Adding X hours would exceed weekly limit of Y hours (current: Z hours)"

### Admin Bypass
Admins can bypass limits by including `bypassLimits: true` in the request body.
